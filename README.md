Overview/Description: This is meant to be a personal site for my music (and art, eventually).

Home page is meant to have most recent info/releases. the Music page has an accordian with Latest Release, Singles, and Features sections; two of these sections have a carousel containg cover art with links to take any user to the currently available music on theirmajor streaming platform of choice (Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube). Store coming soon!

Technology Used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, & Google Fonts 

User Stories:
    1. User hears my music and wants to learn more about me, so they find my website (Navigate from home page to about me/story page)
    2. User wants to see if there is any merch available, so they go to my website to see if we currently sell any (navigate from home page to store page)
    3. User wants to contact me directly, so they go to my site to find a form of contact. (Navigate from home, to contact page, sends me a message.)



Ideas for Future Improvement: 
    1. Links to Social Media platforms on Contact page, maybe have a dropdown menu for the Contact Button. 
    2. Nav to change to dropdown Navbar on sm screen and below.
    3. Complete "Store" page with available merch.
    4. Form and ability to order and pay for real merchandise when available after store page is up and running. 
    5. Include a carousel with pictures for the 'Story" page.
    6. Put artist and label icons/logos on website.
